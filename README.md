# Funny Fortunes

## Technologies Used:
#### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

## What this app does:
Funny Fortunes exists for giphy lovers who'd want to have their fortunes told.  Instead of a long and involved Tarot card reading, or an appointment with a psychic, a user can type into the search field what he'd want to know about in relation to their future, click on a giphy and get a prediction right away.  The value of this app is purely entertainment, although, self-fulfilling prophecies can also occur.

## Unsolved Problems
1.  The height of the images at 650px width and lower could be more consistent.
2.  The prediction message could have Twitter, Facebook and Instagram share buttons.
Hopefully, both of these things will be included in version 2.0
